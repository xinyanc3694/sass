# Entry 7: Beginning Project (Week 1)

This week was exciting for me. Me and my teammates are finally starting on our project. I mentioned last week that I was having struggles on deciding which project we want to work on, so we fianlly decided to work on the old website. The reason is because for the old website, we already have the layout so the only thing we have to do is fix the design, so then if we want to suddenly change our plan and make a profolio instead, we can just simply change the context. Therefore, this is the best choice.

## Project Process

When we first starting to work on the project, each of us was responsible for one section of the wesite so then we do not get confused and create an error. During the process, one challenge that I faced is trying to get used to coding with SASS. Because I coded with CSS before and since CSS is really simply to SASS, I got confused when I code with SASS. I am already used to coding with CSS, so this transition to SASS was difficult. I will be coding with SASS but all of sudden, I will switch to CSS without knowing. By the time that I realized it, I have already wrote a chunk of code, so then I will have to delete everything and restart over again. This did took up some time when we were working on the project, but luckily that did not slow down the progress of the project much. 

To overcome this challenge, I try to check my code every time I write something, just to make sure that I wrote it in SASS. This helps eliminate possible chances of me getting the syntax wrong. In addition, if I am not sure about the syntax of how to change something, font-size of something, for instance, I can just search it up in Google for the syntax of it in SASS. This might take up time, but compare to the time I put on restarting over and over again, it would not be as long.

Our project is not finished, so some of the designs and features of the website are not as elegant.

## Next Steps:
1. Change the font size, font style, and color of the words.
2. Reorganized the position of each chunk of context.
3. Change the carousel into something like below, so when the mouse hovers over, a quote will pop up as the image fades:

4. Change the background color.

## Takeaway(s)
1. When you feel overwhelm or upset, take a short break and then come back to the project. I mentioned before that there were a few times that I have to restart my code because I coded in the wrong language. Even though it was not a big problem, but I did get annoyed because of it. So taking a break allows me to chill down and have a clear thought.
2. Do not be discourage. Like you can see in my "Next Steps", I still have quite a few more things to work on the website. And considering that I only have one or two more weeks left for the whole thing, I did got nervous and scared whether I can actually finish it in time. But it is okay, as long that me and my partners work on a part of the website, we will be finish in no time.
