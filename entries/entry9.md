# Entry 9: Presentation

We are finally done with our project. It is time to sum everything up in the slides that we will present in class. But first we have to decide on what we will include in our slides that can best illustrate our project process. We looked at the sample presentation slides that our teacher provided and decided on the important things that we want to incorporate.

### Things that we decided to include:
1. Images of our website before and after SASS to show the changes that we make to our old website
2. Codes that we used to transform our old website and explain what each chunk of it do to our website
3. Explanation of the programming language that we explored for the last 9 weeks
4. Explanation of the purpose of our website

## Takeaway(s):
1. Be proud of your project. Even though it is not perfect, but you have work hard on it.
